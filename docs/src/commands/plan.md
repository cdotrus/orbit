# __orbit plan__

## __NAME__

plan - generate a blueprint file

## __SYNOPSIS__

```
orbit plan [options]
```

## __DESCRIPTION__

This command carries out the "planning phase". This phase involves reading
and writing to the lockfile and collecting all necessary files according to 
their defined fileset into a blueprint file for future build processes. This 
command acts upon the current working ip.

By default, the top level unit and testbench are auto-detected according to
the current design heirarchy. If there are multiple candidates for a potential
top level or testbench, it will exit and ask the user to explicitly select
a candidate. To include all top levels and testbenches, use `-all`.

The top level unit and testbench will be stored in a `.env` file within the
build directory. This `.env` file is read during the build command to set
the proper environment variables for downstream targets and scripts that
may require this information. If a known target is provided with `--target`,
then it will also be stored in the `.env` file to be recalled during the
build phase.

User-defined filesets are only collected within the current working ip's 
path. Targets may have custom filesets defined in their configuration. When
specifying a known target with `--target`, it will collect the filesets 
defined for that target. Use `--fileset` as many times as needed to define
additional filesets.

During the planning phase, a lockfile is produced outlining the exact ip
dependencies required, how to get them, and how to verify them. The lockfile
should be checked into version control and should not manually edited by the 
user.

If the current working ip's manifest data matches its data stored in its
own lockfile, then Orbit will read from the lockfile to create the ip
dependency graph. To force Orbit to build the ip dependency graph from
scratch, use `--force`.
  
If only needing to update the lockfile, use `--lock-only`. This flag does 
not require a toplevel or testbench to be determined. Using `--lock-only` with
`--force` will overwrite the lockfile regardless if it is already in sync 
with the current working ip's manifest data.

When updating the lockfile, this command will download and install any new
dependencies if necessary. To only download an ip, see the `download` command.
To only install an ip, see the `install` command.

If an installed dependency's computed checksum does not match the checksum
stored in the lockfile, it assumes the installation to be corrupt and will 
re-install the dependency to the cache.

`--target-dir <dir>`  
      The relative directory to place the blueprint.tsv file

`--fileset <key=glob>...`  
      A glob-style pattern identified by a name to add into the blueprint

`--clean`  
      Removes all files from the build directory before execution

`--list`
