# The Book of Orbit

![](./images/orbit_logo_128px.png)

Orbit is an agile package manager and extensible build tool for hardware description languages (HDL). Its design is driven by two core principles:

- minimize technical debt associated with evolving HDL codebases
- tailor to the wide range of users and their possible workflows with a high degree of modularity and extensibility 

Orbit's use case is targeted toward anyone interested in developing digital hardware; this includes industrial, academic, and personal settings. Create your next commerical product, university lab assignment, or personal project, using a tool that is tailored to today's advanced development processes.

## Sections
This "book" is loosely divided into 4 sections:
1. [Tutorials](./tutorials/tutorials.md) - Step-by-step lessons working with Orbit
2. [User Guide](./user/user.md) - General procedures for "how-to" solve common problems
3. [Topic Guide](./topic/topic.md) - Explanations that clarify and provide more detail to particular topics
4. [Reference](./reference/reference.md) - Technical information

## About the Project

Orbit is available free to use and open source to encourage adoption, contribution, and integration among the hardware community. We rely on the open source community for feedback and new ideas, while remaining focused on our design goals and principles.

The project is currently open-source under the GPL-3.0 license and is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/chaseruskin/orbit).

## About the Documentation

The documentation system and methodology adopted by Orbit is inspired by [Divio](https://documentation.divio.com).
