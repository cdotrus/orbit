    new - create a new ip

SYNOPSIS
    orbit new [options] <path>

DESCRIPTION
    Creates a new ip at the target directory '<path>'. The path is assumed to not
    already exist. A new directory will be created at the file system destination
    that contains a minimal manifest file.
    
    If no name is supplied, then the ip's name defaults to the final directory name
    taken from '<path>'. Using the '--name' option allows this field to be
    explicitly set.
    
    For initializing an already existing project into an ip, see the 'init' 
    command.

OPTIONS
    <path>
        Directory to create for the ip

    --name <name>
        Set the resulting ip's name

    --lib <lib>
        Set the resulting ip's library

EXAMPLES
    orbit new gates
    orbit new eecs/lab1 --name adder
"#;
