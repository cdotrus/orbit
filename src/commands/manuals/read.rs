    read - lookup hdl source code

SYNOPSIS
    orbit read [options] <unit>

DESCRIPTION
    Navigates hdl source code to lookup requested hdl code snippets. Looking up
    hdl source code to see its implementation can help gain a better understanding
    of the code being reused in your current design.
    
    By default, the resulting code is displayed to the console. To write the
    results to a file for improved readability, use the '--save' option. Combining 
    the '--locate' option with the '--save' option will append the line and column
    number of the identified code snippet to the end of the resulting file path.
    
    If no ip is provided by the '--ip' option, then it will assume to search the
    local ip for the provided design unit.
    
    The values for options '--start', '--end', and '--doc' must be valid hdl code. 
    The code is interpreted in the native language of the provided design unit.
    
    The '--doc' option will attempt to find the comments immediately preceding the
    identified code snippet. 
    
    Every time this command is called, it attempts to clean the temporary
    directory where it saves resulting files. To keep existing files on the next
    call of this command, use the '--no-clean' option.

OPTIONS
    <unit>
        Read the file for this hdl design unit

    --ip <spec>
        Ip specification

    --doc <code>
        Find the preceding comments to the code snippet

    --save
        Write the results to a temporary read-only file

    --start <code>
        Start the lookup after jumping to this code snippet

    --end <code>
        Stop the lookup after finding this code snippet

    --limit <num>
        Set a maximum number of source code lines to write

    --no-clean
        Do not clean the temporary directory of existing files

    --locate
        Append the line and column number to the resulting file

EXAMPLES
    orbit read and_gate --limit 25
    orbit read math_pkg --ip math --doc "function clog2" --start "package math_pkg"
    orbit read math_pkg --ip math --doc "function flog2p1" --save --locate
