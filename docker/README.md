# /docker

This folder contains Dockerfiles to automate the creation of docker images to be used with Orbit.

The images are stand-alone with `orbit` ready-to-use on a base operating system and with minimal runtime dependencies. It is encouraged for these images to be integrated with others to assist in an EDA workflow.
